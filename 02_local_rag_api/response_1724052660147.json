  "search_result": "According to the provided information, there is no direct discussion about heart failure and exercise tolerance. However, it does mention \"risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) during exercise\" and mentions that \"a proportion of these participants, with a mean age of 40 to 50 years old, have predisposing risk factors and may have a cardiac event during training or racing\".\n\nThe context also mentions the Seattle criteria for screening in athletes, which are used for identifying high-risk ECG findings warranting further investigation. Additionally, it is stated that attempts to correlate ECG changes with echocardiographic findings show limited predictive value of ECGs to reveal underlying cardiac abnormalities.\n\nAs for a paper related to exercise and sudden death, the context mentions that \"The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) first established criteria for pre-participation screening electrocardiograms (ECG) in athletes\" and that more recent refinements were made to high-risk ECG findings warranting further investigation. However, it does not provide details about a specific paper related to exercise and sudden death.\n\nI don't have knowledge about heart failure and exercise tolerance beyond what is mentioned in the provided context.",
